      "description": "Come one come all Bargain hunters!! This is the mecca of savings for everything you are looking for. The Visiting Nurse Association has this as their biggest fundraiser of the year and it's well worth your attendance. No entry fee. 3 days long! May 3rd, 4th, &amp; 5th!!!\n\nMany of you have probably heard me talk about this sale so excitedly and have asked I let you know when it is so you too can attend.\n\nCome alone or come with kids it's up to you. Check out the website below to get more info:\n\nwww.visitingnurse.org\/news-and-events\/rummage\n\nDetails:\n\nThere is a tent that serves food, hamburgers, coffee, etc.. I recommend arriving early to shop. To re-iterate what Iz said:: This is a great flea market\\yard sale! I have attended it several times and bought lots of good stuff. Get there early, however, as there are many tents in which to shop and LOTS of folks also looking for bargains. There are 20 tents with categories, a select few take credit cards, ALL take cash. There are sizes for everyone, and yes there's a tent just for MENSWEAR! - Michael i know you're happy. :)\n\nHere's the scoop on the 3 days:\n\nDay 1 - it's first look at everything that's been acquired &amp; sorted over the last month by volunteers. People typically start to line up at a tent of their choice as early as 830.\n\nDay 2 - regular day of shopping\n\nDay 3- HALF PRICE DAY! - so every tent all items are half price, and most tents also have a \"buy the bag\" option. Each tent has their own pricing, so as an example the office supplies tent does a $5.00 buy the bag, where bon ton has 3 different sizes to chose from $25, $55, $75.\n\nI take Friday off and go for a few hours, last year I stayed almost all day, and I come again on Sunday for the buy a bag for the day. I'll give everyone that reply's yes my contact info in an email a few days prior. I hope all of you find really awesome treasures! ~Dani\n\nYou can take a train from Penn Station, NYC, to the Far Hills station stop in NJ on the Gladstone line. I think it's $14.25 each way, but it might be cheaper if you buy a round trip tik. Also, I think they have discounts for seniors, students, and disabled.

THIS IS A SELF-GUIDED EVENT\n\nJoin us for a cool glass of wine at the Noguchi Museum Sculpture Garden.\n\nThe Noguchi Museum offers extended evening hours on the first Friday of each month from 5:00PM to 8:00PM. First Friday programming includes \"Center of Attention,\" an extended conversation around a single work of art at 6:00PM, followed by a film presented in collaboration with the Architecture and Design Film Festival, at 7:00PM.\n\nFirst Fridays also feature pay-what-you-wish admission and a cash bar with wine and beer.\n\nMay's Film will be: Modern Tide: Mid-Century Architecture on Long Island\n\nThis film inaugurates the second year of collaborative programming with the Architecture and Design Film Festival. Jake Gorst's film Modern Tide take the viewer through the history of the modernist housing boom that took place on Long Island, NY in the period between the Great Depression of the 1970's, and highlights the importance of architectural preservation.\n\nNoguchi brought together East and West in a unique and distinctly poetic style.\n\nHe was able to enrich his sculpture with an aura of magical suspension and inner glow that permeates throughout the museum.\n\nIsamu Noguchi (1904\ufffd1988), an internationalist, traveled extensively throughout his life.  (In his later years he maintained studios both in Japan and New York.)  He discovered the impact of large-scale public works in Mexico, earthy ceramics and tranquil gardens in Japan, subtle ink-brush techniques in China, and the purity of marble in Italy.  He incorporated all of these impressions into his work, which utilized a wide range of materials, including stainless steel, marble, cast iron, balsawood, bronze, sheet aluminum, basalt, granite, and water.\n\nTo read more about Noguchi, and the Noguchi Museum click HERE\n\nTo read an interview with Isamu Noguch cionducted by Paul Cummings at the Artist's studio in Long Island City, click HERE\n\nPLEASE READ!\n\nAN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM ANDREYA'S ASSISTANT\n\nIf you RSVP and do not show up to an event for three times, you will be expelled.

If you have any suggestions please let us know. Please note that it should be good for a group of at least 20 people.\n\nAnswers to FAQs:\n\n- If you come later, no problem. Usually we are there for some hours (some of us even till midnight).\n\n- If you don't speak German, no problem. There are always some people who prefer speaking in English or at least switch all the time.\n\n- You can already see (and probably hear) us from the entrance of the Churrascaria. Usually we sit in the bar area and speak German :-)\n\nHope to see you there.",

      "description": "We did this exactly 1 year ago and it was good fun and a good introduction to croquet.\n\nExtreme croquet is a broken down cut-throat version of Nine Wicket croquet that you would play in your backyard.  The objective is to get your one ball through all the wickets in the course before your opponents.  I will teach all the basics like how to swing a mallet (it's between your legs, unlike golf), how to hit a ball and and all the rules.  I've been playing for 9 years and was the director of education at the New York Croquet Club for 4 years, so I've got this dialed down!\n\nI will bring about 10 balls and 3 spare mallets.  You might have to share mallets depending on who shows, but it's no big deal.  As for clothes, wear whatever you want.  You don't need to wear white as is typically expected at posh country clubs.  This is eXtreme!\n\nCentral Park doesn't allow anything that might damage their main lawns like paper thin wickets, so we can't do this in the sheep meadow, but we'll play in rough grass north of the lawn sports center (west of Mineral Springs), or directly west of that huge rock.  Refer to picture below.  I'd like to meet in that red box.  Mineral Springs is the blue circle, and the arrow originates from the 69th street pedestrian entrance on CPW.\n\nSunlight should last from 6pm to about 8pm.  Afterward, we'll retire at the Shalel lounge for a drink and\/or food.  Shalel is on 70th between Columbus and Central Park West.  You could also skip the croquet and just meet me at Shalel later.  Let me know!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/shalel-lounge-new-york",

      "description": "\"Opportunities do not float like clouds. They are firmly attached to individuals. If you\ufffdre looking for an opportunity, you\ufffdre really looking for people. If you\ufffdre evaluating an opportunity, you\ufffdre really evaluating people. If you\ufffdre trying to marshal resources to go after an opportunity, you\ufffdre really trying to enlist the support and involvement of other people. A company doesn\ufffdt offer you a job, people and businesses do.Opportunities flow through congregations of people. Those with good ideas and information tend to hang out with one another. You will get ahead if you can tap the circles that dish the best opportunities. In fact, it\ufffds how people have gotten ahead for centuries.\"\n\nHere is a link to my previous mastermind group in California held at my old office. These guys have gone on and done great things.

As you enter the building, guests are encouraged to take a self-guided tour of the library and current exhibitions. Many of the library and NYPL staff and executives attend, as well as a wide variety of professionals from many backgrounds and industries.\n\nAll visitors are welcome to Hors d'oeuvres and beverages catered by Melba\ufffds while enjoying\/dancing to DJ music. It\ufffds a great way to meet and greet members of the community while learning more about the arts, culture and history of Harlem.\n\nAlthough the picture to the right show the event outdoors, they were taken during the spring\/summer season. The event is indoors for the fall\/winter months.\n\nWe'll meet in the library lobby next to the Information Desk at 6:00pm to gather there. The event at the Schomburg will end at 9pm.\n\nPlease find me (Daniel) in the area to the right of the information desk - I (as well as others) will be wearing a \"GO\" name tag - similar to the logo and the image to the left &lt;&lt; on the front of my jacket\/shirt, and name tags will be given out to identifiy other members.\n\nAfterwards, we'll head down to\n\nGinny's Supper Club at Red Rooster\n\n(www.ginnyssupperclub.com) to keep the good spirits going with a nightcap of drinks, socializing and dancing. We'll arrive at Ginny's around 9:30pm and will end the meetup there officially at 11pm.

      "description": "This will be session one of four photography workshops in the month of May. The objective of the series of workshops is to learn basic photography techniques, view the works of master photographers, and have hands on experience with peer-to-peer critique of your work. It will be designed so that participants can chose to participate in all sessions or pick and chose sessions as they choose based in their needs and interests (however curriculum will be designed for students who want to participate in all classes). Ultimately I would like to put the images up in a show that we would curate as a group around Ramadan (if participants choose to do so). I would like to give the class a little bit of freedom in the workshop but would also like a theme so the first session we can discuss how to frame the personal project. Please note that participants are responsible for the cost of all materials.\n\nWeek 1:\n\nIntroduction to class and objectives\nElements of a good photo\nPhotography techniques\nSoftware editing techniques\nHow to chose the best photos to fit your story\nFraming of personal project (to be completed by week 4)\nHow to operate the camera (for those who bring their camera to class and have questions on how to operate it, this will be done at the end of class on an individual basis so that others may leave if they wish to do so)\n\nRequirements:\n\nYou do not need to bring these to class but they will be necessary for shooting assignments\nCamera: Digital SLR is the best option, however since not everyone can afford one you can bring a point and shoot camera. If you cannot afford a point and shoot camera but have a good quality camera built into your smartphone (such as an iPhone) you can feel free to use that, however a proper camera is best.\nPhoto editing software: Photoshop is the best option ($699.00), however since not everyone can afford Photoshop, there is a a Photoshop Elements version ($99.99) which is a little more limited however has a lot of great features you can use to edit your images. Both are available for Mac and PC. Another option for PC users is Microsoft Photo Manager, however this product is extremely limiting. You may also download the trial version of each of these products for free for 30 days.\n\nAbout the Instructor:\n\nAlexandra holds a BFA in photojournalism from the Rochester Institute of Technology and is one of the organizers of the Progressive Muslim Meetup. Her main interest is in documentary photography and has worked on several projects documenting the Muslim community in New York.",

This acclaimed Met exhibit combines beautiful Impressionist paintings with both pictures and actual spectacular period clothing to tell a story about how people saw their lives at that time.\n\nWe will meet in the center of the main Met lobby, wait 5-10 minutes, then buy tickets and go in, so if you arrive late, just buy your ticket and come in to the exhibit area to look for us. If you get lost, you can text me at 917-725-0767.\n\nNote that the museum is open late Fridays, until 9pm. After seeing this exhibit, if there's time we can wander around the museum to see other things, for example this well-reviewed photography exhibit: http:\/\/www.metmuseum.org\/exhibitions\/listings\/2013\/photography-and-the-american-civil-war. Note also that the recommended admission is $25, but that figure is merely recommended and you're free to pay what you wish.",

And don't take the RSVP too seriously - people are coming now who don't RSVP. The word is getting out....\n\nEveryone is invited! Dharma Drink is all about building community amongst the Buddhist and like minded crowd in New York City. I was inspired to start Dharma Drink by hanging out with all of the great students of all of the different lamas in Kathmandu - Kagyu, Nyingma, Sakya, Gelugpa - totally Rimey (also Zen, Thai, Theravadan, yoga travelers, and the curious - just about everyone!).  We all became great friends and learned from each other. We're there every Friday night - see you there.\n\nMotivation:  To make the Rubin Museum Lounge on Friday night the Buddhist and like minded hang-out spot in New York.\n\nWho:  ALL ARE INVITED.  Feel free to spread the word.  The more,             the merrier.\n\nTime:  7-?pm\n\nDate:  Every Friday - like clockwork\n\nPlace:  Rubin Museum Lounge, 17th Street and 7th Avenue\n\nHow to find us:  Look for a table with the small sign \"Dharma Drink\"                          + Lounge staff  will know where we are.\n\nPlease see the following Meetups too!\n\nBuddhist Events New York     and\n\nZen \/ Chan Buddhist Activities\n\nwww.dharmadrink.com",

You are NOT confirmed for this event unless you pre-pay. RSVPing along does not hold a spot for you.\n\nSee payment link below in red font.\n\nWe do not accept payment at the door for these events. No exceptions.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAren't you tired of emailing back and forth with that person from Match.com or OKCupid only to end up being blown off or disappointed? Here's a fun and easy way to cut to the chase, save time and have fun all at the same time.\n\nShow up and enjoy happy hour as all guests arrive and check in. Grab a drink and nibble the appetizers while you get ready to meet your matches.\n\nJoin other single professionals for an early evening happy hour, topped off with about* 7-10 rounds of \"mini-dates.\" You'll meet each member of the opposite sex for 5-7 minutes each (depending on the size of the event), turn in your dating card and then we'll send you the contact info of your mutual matches 48 hours later. On average, 80% of those who attend end up with at least one or two mutual matches.\n\nWhy only 7-10 rounds? The more choices in front of someone, the less likely they are to  choose and focus on one specific person. We like to avoid replicating the \"shopping cart\" mentality that occurs with online dating.\n\nWe intentionally keep our speeddating events limited to 7-10 dating rounds. That way , between the pre-event happy hour and the dating rounds, you can spend more time with each participant and try to determine compatibility. (SEE MORE FAQ's BELOW)\n\nIf you don't get any matches, you'll receive a promo code so you can try another event at half price!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAPPETIZERS SERVED DURING CHECK IN\n\nPAYMENT POLICY:\n\n$30 (MUST register with code ATWYS7 - codes can not be applied after registration)\n\n$25 IF YOU PREPAY WITH A FRIEND\n\nREGISTER AND PAY HERE: http:\/\/atwysnycspeed2013.eventbrite.com\/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAbsolutely no refunds to cancellations or no-shows.\n\n(This policy is to help us ensure a close to even as possible gender ratio.)\n\nHere's why you should try speeddating:\n\n1. You Improve Your Flirting &amp; Communication skills - You went out, you interacted with people, you worked your flirt a bit. One's inability to interact or communicate effectively is one of the biggest hurdles when it comes to dating.\n\n2. You Hone Your Dating Instincts - The more exposure you have to such different types of people, the quicker you learn to spot and avoid red flags or incompatibility. You become better at picking up clues and signs.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFAQ'S\n\nThe Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?\n\nThat number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.\n\nWhat should I wear?\n\nBusiness casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.\n\nWhat if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?\n\nGo for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.\n\nCan I see photos of other attendees?\n\nMost people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.\n\nWhere are all the RSVPs?\n\nAbout 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our main events website. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.\n\nWhat's The Refund Policy?\n\nSince we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.\n\nCan I bring a friend for moral support?\n\nYou'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.\n\nWill there be equal numbers of men or women?\n\nThat's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.\n\nPLEASE REMEMBER:\n\n* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside Dating Advice &amp; Events Website. We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.\n\n*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.\n\nSee other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.",

We'll Meet up at about 7:00 at one of two places--you guys decide which one!\n\nWe'll meet up either at :\n\nHotel Indigo's Glass Bar in Chelsea\n\nTime Out New York describes the glass bar like this:\n\nGlass Bar at Hotel Indigo\nThe bar name is quite literal here: The perimeter of the 20-story rooftop is lined with glowing glass walls and is topped by a glass roof to shelter drinkers from the elements during the off-season. Sip specialty cocktails like the Spicy Rita (Jose Cuervo, triple sec, jalape\ufffdo syrup and fresh lime; $12) and the Blu Martini (vodka infused with blueberries and oranges, St. Germain, triple sec and lime; $12), while drinking in the stunning scenery of Chelsea.\n\nGlass Bar: 127 W 28th St, Rooftop\n\nOR\n\nThe Press Lounge\n\nTime Out New York describes the Press Lounge like this:\n\nThe Press Lounge\nApropos its minimalist, modern ideal, this upscale spread\ufffds pi\ufffdce de r\ufffdsistance is a glowing 70-foot-long reflecting pool. Translation: Skip the flip-flops if you want to fit in with the midtown crowd that congregates here to watch the sun set after work. You won\ufffdt be disappointed with the 16th floor\ufffds 360-degree vistas either. There\ufffds plenty of space to lounge on the generously sized deck, and there\ufffds also a glass-enclosed lounge where you can grab a beer or a cocktail.\n\nPress Lounge:  653 11th Ave  New York\n\nPlease RSVP and vote by Wednesday so we have plenty of time to let people know where we'll be on Friday night!\n\nAlso, for those of you who have their partying shoes on, we'll hit up LQ on Lexington after the happy hour. Time TBD. They have a great deal on their Friday Party, 2 for 1 drinks, free champagne, hookah and buffet if we get a group together ahead of time, so it should be a good time!  Send me an email with your number or other way to contact you if you can't make the happy hour, but still want to come dancing!\n\nLQ: 511 Lexington Ave (between 47th St &amp; 48th St)\n\nCan't wait to see you all!!\n\n~Deb &amp; Atreya",

Many tremendous thanks to Chris, Sam and Charles for their consistant excellence at the game table, and the great feedback they provided.\n\nI'm leaving this slot open for the bi-monthly meeting for any sort of get togethers related to Elthos while I pause the Play Testing for a big old round of finalization and polishing of the system.\n\nThe story has been kinda part fairytale, and part Arthurian myth... I'm writing out the adventures as we go in a kind of prose story form and you can catch up with what's going on by following the links here:\n\nElthos Game Test Stories\n\nAnyone who is open to a medium-weight system and enjoys retro-traditional RPGing, more or less focused on the Role Playing and Story aspect of the game ... you're most welcome!\n\nI will be starting another game in the summer of 2013.   In the meantime I'm looking for a few GMs who may be interested in trying out the system and providing feedback.  Thanks!\n\n:)\n\nMark",

All funds go directly to the medical care above and beyond the basic medical care that the township provides.\n\nThis Uno location also brews it's own beer.  But remember, don't drink and ride.\n\nUno's is usually good with doing separate checks so we just need to ask before ordering.  I will bring certificates with me but they are also available here, http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/581932\/Uno%20doughtickets%20May%202013.pdf , in case you decide to go on a different day.\n\nHere are the details.\n\nDates: May 3 - May 5\n\nValid for dine in or takeout.\n\nUno will donate 15% of your bill if total receipts for the fundraiser are $1,000 or less.\n\nUno will donate 20% of your bill if total receipts for the fundraiser are greater than $1,000.\n\nYou must give a certificate to your server for your bill to count.\n\nHere is a link to their menu --&gt; http:\/\/www.unos.com\/menus\/\n\nFor those that want to continue hanging out, American Chaos (Jim's band) is at Tim Kerwin's starting at 10:00 PM.

Only one thing is certain: no one will get out of this without looking utterly ridiculous!\n\nShow starts at 8pm, so let's meet for drinks beforehand at 6:30pm nearby (place TBD).

But Lebanese hummus wins hands down! This says alot, if their hummus is this good, I can only imagine what the rest of the menu will taste like. Not only that, the babaghanous, tabouleh and grilled chicken were also yummy! There was this amazing garlic\/potato\/mayo concoction used as a condiment for the chicken. Rave reviews on their schwarma! And their pita was different; thin, delicious and huge! The food came from El-Rawsheh in Astoria. Offering the likes of various schwarma, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, salads and soups, meat and non-meat lovers will have fresh, delicious choices at inexpensive prices!\n\nI will collect $1.00 organizer's fee @ the meetup.\n\nCash Only please!

      "description": "My ticket is J17 if you can find something nearby.\n\nHere is the info:\n\nMama is out of the closet and hitting the \"road\" with Vicki Lawrence in Vicki Lawrence and Mama: A Two Woman Show. The show is a mixture of stand-up comedy, music and Vicki's observations about real life.\n\nEmmy Award- winning comedienne Vicki Lawrence is one of the most beloved television personalities of her generation. Plucked out of total obscurity as a high school senior, Vicki went on to become part of the now-legendary cast of the \"Carol Burnett Show.\" \"I went to the Harvard School of Comedy in front of America,\" says Ms. Lawrence of her Burnett Show training.\n\nIn the seventh season, and hundreds of hilarious sketches later, at the ripe, old age of 24, Vicki created her most endearing character to date, Thelma Harper, or \"Mama\" as she is better known to her fans. After the Burnett Show, Vicki went on to star in \"Mama's Family,\" which consistently topped the ratings for its entire six-year run of original shows. \"Mama\" has attained almost a cult status among her legions of loyal television viewers, who still enjoy her in reruns twice daily throughout most of the country.\n\nFor several years now, \"Carol Burnett Show\" alumni, Harvey Korman and Tim Conway have been touring as a comedy act in casinos and performing arts centers and doing skits from the Burnett show to tremendous response. In addition, Vicki and Tim were recently coupled as parents on CBS-TV's \"Yes Dear,\" where their popularity garnered that sitcom its highest ratings to date. Further, the unprecedented ratings for the \"Carol Burnett Showstopper Special,\" which recently delighted more than 50 million viewers, convinced Ms. Lawrence that the time is right to take Mama out of the closet, dust off her sensible shoes and hit the road with her new touring production, Vicki Lawrence and Mama: A Two-Woman Show.\n\nMs. Lawrence will take the stage first. \"My new show will not be a retrospective,\" she explains. \"We are designing a show that is a mixture of stand-up comedy, music and my observations about real life.\" The multi-talented entertainer is mostly known for her acting and comedic talents, but she also earned a gold record for the 1973 hit, \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia.\"\n\nMs. Lawrence also became one of the few successful female game show hosts when she took on the daytime version of \"'Win, Lose or Draw.\" She further perfected her hosting skills on her own daytime talkshow, \"Vicki!,\" from 1992-1994, becoming the only talkshow host since Oprah to be nominated for an Emmy in her freshman year.\n\nOn stage, Ms. Lawrence has appeared in numerous productions, including Send Me No Flowers, No, No Nanette, My Fat Friend, Chapter Two, Twigs, Hello Dolly, Special Occasions, I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It On The Road, Annie Get Your Gun, and, live from the Grand Ole Opry, Nunsense 3: The Jamboree, which aired on TNN. Most recently she appeared in The Vagina Monologues. Her autobiography, Vicki! The True Life Adventures of Miss Fireball, was published in 1995 by Simon and Schuster.\n\nThe entertainer also travels all over the country speaking to charity groups about her life and career, women's health and being a woman in a man's world. Her efforts to protect women's rights were recognized in 1988 when she was the first woman to be honored as \"Person of the Year\" by the Coalition of Labor Union Women. Her speaking engagements have given her the opportunity to fine-tune much of her comedy.\n\n\"I think people will get a kick out of the things Mama has an opinion about. We're creating new material with a more modern and cutting edge. Where Mama is concerned, expect the unexpected. There's really nothing she can't do,\" she says. \"I hope people will be pleasantly surprised by a side of Vicki they may never have seen\ufffdI know they will be looking forward to Mama, and for her part, that crazy old gal will be up to the challenge.\"",

      "description": "During weekly meetings on Friday evenings in East Meadow, Long Island, Atma-Nivedana dasa (\"Atma\") and Subhangada devi dasi (\"Subhie\") teach how to hear and chant sanskrit names for God in kirtan and a systematic study of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is.  Kirtan meditation consists of hearing and chanting sanksrit names for God to the accompaniment of melodious and rhythmic music in order to invoke God's divine mercy and presence.  Bhagavad Gita As It Is is studied according to the ancient, yet unbroken, chain of teachers, as taught originally by Krishna and eventually Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Rupa Goswami, and more recently A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.\n\nOur focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is.  Everyone will read verses together from the Bhagavad Gita, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup.  Atma and Subhie will together explain the Bhagavad Gita verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for a combined forty years.  We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.\n\nHard cover copies of the beautiful Bhagavad Gita As It Is with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, will be available for any member who might choose to take one home for a suggested donation of $10.\n\nThis meetup is intended for everyone who is interested without discrimination and regardless of one's familiarity with the subject matter.  Please come and relish this most wonderful discussion and kirtan, celebrating the glories of bhakti yoga, i.e., devotional service to God, who is known according to the Bhagavad Gita by the name Krishna.\n\nHere is the general schedule of our meetups: we begin the evening with a kirtan that lasts about twenty minutes -- until about 8:20 p.m.  Then, we have a class on Bhagavad Gita As It Is, which lasts for about an hour and twenty minutes.  In the class, we will go through verses of the Gita in order, continuing from where the last class left off, with questions pertaining to those verses being encouraged throughout the class.  By about 9:40, the last kirtan begins; it lasts for about twenty minutes.  A sumptuous and nutritious vegetarian dinner is served after that.\n\nAdmission to each meetup is free.  Donations for the meetup's expenses are welcome, but not at all required!\n\nAtma is an initiated priest who since 1990 has been studying, teaching, and living according to the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita as taught and followed by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and Bhagavad Gita.  He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship for 75% of tuition.  Currently, Atma spends his weekdays as a securities fraud federal prosecutor.  His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.\n\nSubhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita since 1991 and is also an initiated priest.  Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005.   From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught Bhagavad Gita in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom.  Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana.  After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma.  Subhie just completed her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College.",

He has earned a reputation for putting his expressive gifts and virtuosity at the service of a remarkably wide range of music, and his schedule of recital, concerto, chamber music, teaching, and recording commitments is distinguished with return engagements throughout the U.S. and abroad.\n\nHighlights for 2012-2013 include concertos with the symphonies of Toronto, Spokane, Augusta (GA) and Silicon Valley, a performance of the Lukas Foss Concerto for the New Hampshire Music Festival, duo recitals with acclaimed harpist Yolanda Kondonassis and accordion\/bandoneon virtuoso Julien Labro, solo recitals in Austin and California\ufffds La Guitarra Festival, and another Curtis On Tour sojourn, this time to South America. In May 2012, the Jason Vieaux Guitar Academy was launched in partnership with ArtistWorks Inc., an unprecedented technological interface that provides a one-on-one online study exchange between Vieaux and guitar students around the world.\n\nJason Vieaux continues to bring important repertoire alive in the recording studio. A new Azica Records CD of solo guitar encores is planned for a 2013 release. Among his eleven commercial CDs is an Azica disc of Astor Piazzolla\ufffds music with Julien Labro and A Far Cry Chamber Orchestra. Bach: Works for Lute, Vol. 1 hit number thirteen on Billboard\ufffds Classical Chart after its first week and received rave reviews by Gramophone, The Absolute Sound, and Soundboard. Images of Metheny features music by American jazz legend Pat Metheny, who, after hearing this landmark recording, declared: \ufffdI am flattered to be included in Jason\ufffds musical world.\ufffd Sevilla: The Music of Isaac Albeniz made several top ten lists the year of its release. Vieaux\ufffds CDs and live performances are regularly on the radio and internet, and his work is the subject of feature articles in print and internet media outlets around the world every year, including magazines such as Acoustic Guitar, MUSO and Gramophone. He is a regular contributor to NPR\ufffds Deceptive Cadence, a blog series on classical music.\n\nJason Vieaux has performed as concerto soloist with over 50 orchestras, including Cleveland, San Diego, Ft. Worth, Santa Fe, Charlotte, Buffalo, Grand Rapids, Kitchener-Waterloo, Richmond, IRIS Chamber, Chautauqua Festival, and Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia. Some of the conductors he has worked with recently include David Robertson, Michael Stern, Jahja Ling, Miguel Harth-Bedoya, Stefan Sanderling, David Lockington, Steven Smith, and Edwin Outwater. His solo recitals have been featured at every major guitar series in North America, as well as many of the important guitar festivals in Asia, Australia, Europe, and Mexico. Vieaux\ufffds appearances for Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Music@Menlo, Strings Music Festival, Grand Teton Festival, and the Jupiter Symphony Chamber Players have forged his reputation as a first-rate chamber musician and programmer. And his passion for new music has fostered premieres of works by Dan Visconti, David Ludwig, Jerod Tate, Eric Sessler, Jos\ufffd Luis Merlin and Gary Schocker.\n\nIn 2011, Jason Vieaux co-founded the Guitar Department at The Curtis Institute of Music with guitarist David Starobin, while continuing to head of the Guitar Department of the Cleveland Institute of Music. He is a member of the Advisory Board of the Guitar Foundation of America (GFA), and is affiliated with Philadelphia\ufffds Astral Artists, for which he gives outreach concerts. Mr. Vieaux\ufffds primary teachers were Jeremy Sparks and John Holmquist. In 1992 he was awarded the prestigious GFA International Guitar Competition 1st Prize, the event\ufffds youngest winner ever. He is also honored with a Naumburg Foundation top prize, a Cleveland Institute of Music Alumni Achievement Award, and a Salon di Virtuosi Career Grant.",
